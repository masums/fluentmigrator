This folder contains FluentMigrator's Architecture Decision Records (ADR).  The Architecture Decision Log is recorded as pristine merged commits.

The intent of these ADRs is to provide contributors with design rationale, so that if they find issues with the product, they can make recommendations to improve and surpass previous designs.
