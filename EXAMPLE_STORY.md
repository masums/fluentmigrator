It would be helpful if users wrote user stories in user-action-benefit triples.

Consider the following three refinements:

1. “As a Spotify user, I would like to add songs to a playlist.” _Can I break this down further?_ (Yes).
2. “As a Spotify user, I would like a menu option to add a song to a playlist.” _Specifying the mechanism._
3. “As a Spotify user, I would like new songs to be added to the bottom of the playlist.” _Specifying the policy enacted by the mechanism._

In these examples, the benefits aren't super clear. The user and action are super clear in 2 and 3, but in different ways. Articulating the benefits may not be necessary, but it can help tackle complexity when users ask for contradictory requirements:

> “As a Spotify user, I would like new songs to be added to the top of the playlist.”
> 
> _Specifying the policy enacted by the mechanism; conflicts with story 3._
> 
> _Can it be enhanced by specifying what the benefits are?_ (Yes.)

> “As a Spotify user, I would like new songs to be added to the top of the Playlist, so that when I'm talking to friends on Facebook Messenger and they mention a song I should listen to, I can immediately listen to it without losing my playlist.”
> 
> _(Ugh, that's so annoying, Spotify/Facebook!! :) )_
